# Data-Analysis-WeRateDogs-Project

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
WeRateDogs tweet Data Wrangling project is about gathering data from three different sources, to 
perform cleansing methods to bring out the quality and tidiness of the data which can later on be use for 
analysis. The dataset that was worked on by me is the tweet archive dataset of twitter user @dog_rate, which 
is also referred to as WeRateDogs. This twitter account rates so many peopleâ€™s dogs with a lot of likes 
and comments about dogs. The WeRateDogs has over 9 million followers and they are widely known.

### REQUIREMENTS

### RECOMMENDATIONS: 
There should be events hosted for dogs.

  Maugre the fact that they deserve being given the credit for accurate ways of rating dogs,they 
should look forward to other unique ways of human service to rating dogs.
